The entirety of phphaste was built with php and using slim framework for apis
and creating new hastes.

# why?
phphaste was created because the developer benny was scrolling through his websites
and noticed a crappy haste server he put together not long ago and decided to revamp
it with slim framework and then he got stuck into developing it and now he cant leave!
